    <p> This is Buzz Lightyear. He is a Pomchi and about 4 months old.<br> He loves biting pants by the ankles and playing outside in the backyard.
    <br> His favorite toy is everything around him. He thinks he's a vegetarian and <br> sometimes tries to eat plants, but I think now he knows better. </p>
    <br> Here are some of Buzz's favorite links:<br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0"> Buzz solving a Rubik's cube </a>
    <br> <a href="https://www.dogpile.com/"> Buzz's favorite search engine </a>
    <br> <a href="https://www.barkbox.com/"> Care packages </a>
